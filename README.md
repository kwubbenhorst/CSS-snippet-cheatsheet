# CSS-snippet-cheatsheet

## Description:
An application that stores selectable snippets of CSS code on cards to create particular favourite effects

This mini project uses HTML and CSS to create a webpage that will allow a user to view a collection of labeled CSS snippets in a responsive grid. Each snippet is held on a card that is clearly labelled with a heading and the code can be highlighted by clicking on it.  

As much as possible the HTML was created using semantic elements. CSS variables were used to maintain clean and reusable values for a color scheme. Flexbox and media queiries together were used to create the responsive layout. The HTML <pre> tag was used to preserve the formatting of the code snippets, and selectability was ensured using the CSS user-select property. The code snippets themselves were used in the stylesheet of the application to create a linear gradient for the background color of the cards (the CSS background-image property), to create a subtle animation effect on the card headings (the CSS transition property with the pseudo-class hover), and to position the card headers overlaying the top border of the card (the CSS margin property with a negative value). The application was built with responsive design so that its six cards can be viewed as two rows of three on desktops, as three rows of two on tablets and as a single column on smartphones. 

I was given a mockup as a model to replicate.  The six images in the images folder of this repository can be compared, three for mockup at different screen widths and three for mine.  They are not identical but certainly constitute a recognizable likeness.  Below are some screenshots of my application at three different screen widths:
